					.title.grid-33 problem

					.description.prefix-33 
						At trade shows and other conferences, the team showcases software as well as hardware. For displaying the IDE Kinoma Studio, we wanted a stand that would elevate the laptop to make it easy to see and more polished than a laptop on the table. The stand needed to hold the laptop securely and be able to pack flat for travel.

					.description.prefix-33 I designed 5-piece, flat-pack acrylic laptop stand.

					.title.grid-33 insights

					.description.prefix-33 
						With early designs, I listened to qualitative feedback from test subjects and observed the following problems and discomforts:
						%br
						%span.issue-title BRITTLENESS// 
						the crossbars had a weak point where they were likely to break
						%br
						%span.issue-title DANGER TO SELF// 
						the pieces had right angles that made it possible to hurt yourself during assembly
						%br
						%span.issue-title DANGER TO LAPTOP// 
						users feared that the acrylic would scratch their laptops
						%br
						%span.issue-title FLIMSINESS// 
						users did not want to place their laptops on something they thought was flimsy
						%br
						%span.issue-title "THE MARK"// 
						when one user opened his laptop with one hand, it slid off the front of the stand
				%div.section
					.title.grid-33 design decisions 

					.description.prefix-33 
						With feedback in mind, the following modifications were made
						%br
						%span.solution-title BRITTLENESS//  
						added relief cuts in the crossbars to distribute the stress
						%br
						%span.solution-title DANGER TO SELF// 
						radiused the edges 
						%br
						%span.solution-title DANGER TO LAPTOP// 
						added felt to the hard edges of the stand
						%br
						%span.solution-title FLIMSINESS// 
						added a snap-fit mechanism to allow the two pieces to fit together snugly regardless of exact material thickness. 
						%br
						%span.solution-title "THE MARK"// 
						added little ridges to keep the bottom of the laptop from rolling off of the stand.
